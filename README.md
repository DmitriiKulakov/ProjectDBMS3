System Requirements:
The database which is requested will enable the Customer Loyalty System of the business. In general,
a customer loyalty program should support:
• The customer signs up to the company loyalty program using their information (phone 
number, email, etc.)
• Customer possibly receives rewards when he/she subscribes
• Customer receives rewards for purchases or through promotional materials
• Customer can redeem points for discounts or gifts in a points program
• Customer can check his/her status, available points and available rewards online
• Customer can redeem points online by selecting some available reward
The database which is requested should keep track of all the required data for the above system. 
Once the database is implemented, you should add realistic sample data and implement, using SQL, 
realistic sample queries for potential users.
